 About Percona XtraBackup
==========================

*Percona XtraBackup* is the world's only open-source, free |MySQL| hot backup
software that performs non-blocking backups for |InnoDB| and |XtraDB|
databases. With *Percona XtraBackup*, you can achieve the following benefits:

* Backups that complete quickly and reliably
* Uninterrupted transaction processing during backups
* Savings on disk space and network bandwidth
* Automatic backup verification
* Higher uptime due to faster restore time

See the compatibility matrix in `Percona Software and Platform Lifecycle
<https://www.percona.com/services/policies/percona-software-platform-lifecycle>`_
to find out which versions of |MySQL|, |MariaDB|, and |Percona Server| are
supported by |Percona XtraBackup|.

Non-blocking backups of |InnoDB|, |XtraDB|, and *HailDB* storage engines are
supported. In addition, |Percona XtraBackup| can back up the following storage
engines by briefly pausing writes at the end of the backup: |MyISAM|,
:term:`Merge <.MRG>`, and :term:`Archive <.ARM>`, including partitioned tables,
triggers, and database options.

.. important::

   |Percona XtraBackup| 2.4 does not support the MyRocks or TokuDB storage engines.

Percona's enterprise-grade commercial `MySQL Support
<http://www.percona.com/mysql-support/>`_ contracts include support for
|Percona XtraBackup|. We recommend support for critical production deployments.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#n-1] |InnoDB| tables are still locked while copying non-|InnoDB| data.

.. [#n-2] Fast incremental backups are supported for |Percona Server| with
          XtraDB changed page tracking enabled.

.. [#n-3] |Percona XtraBackup| supports encryption with any kinds of backups.
          *MySQL Enterprise Backup* only supports encryption for single-file
          backups.

.. [#n-4] |Percona XtraBackup| performs throttling based on the number of IO
          operations per second. *MySQL Enterprise Backup* supports a
          configurable sleep time between operations.

.. [#n-5] |Percona XtraBackup| skips secondary index pages and recreates them
          when a compact backup is prepared. *MySQL Enterprise Backup* skips
          unused pages and reinserts on the prepare stage.

.. [#n-6] |Percona XtraBackup| can export individual tables even from a full
          backup, regardless of the InnoDB version. *MySQL Enterprise Backup*
          uses InnoDB 5.6 transportable tablespaces only when performing a
          partial backup.

.. [#n-7] Tables exported with |Percona XtraBackup| can be imported into
          |Percona Server| 5.1, 5.5 or 5.6+, or |MySQL| 5.6+. Transportable
          tablespaces created with *MySQL Enterprise Backup* can only be
          imported to |Percona Server| 5.6+, |MySQL| 5.6+ or |MariaDB| 10.0+.

.. [#n-8] Backup locks is a lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
          LOCK`` available in |Percona Server| 5.6+. |Percona XtraBackup| uses
          them automatically to copy non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML
          queries that modify |InnoDB| tables.

..  [#n-9] |Percona XtraBackup| 2.4 only supports |Percona XtraDB Cluster| 5.7.
